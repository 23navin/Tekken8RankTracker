Images were downscaled to 74 × 37 images to match their size on a 720p game capture.
Some rank images that did not match correctly were replaced with screengrabs from youtube vods.
Low bitrate 720p videos after both Twitch and Youtube compression can have really bad matching with uncompressed images, even if they are the same resolution technically.
Most of the time its fine, but if there are matching issues, it may be best to replace all with screengrabs to account for the compression.
