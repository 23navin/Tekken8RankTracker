# Tekken 8 Rank Tracker

A Python script that uses OpenCV and PyTesseract to track a player's Tekken 8 rank progression from a youtube vod. This is a personal project and my first time using python. It is not complete and will probably go through many revisions as I learn the language and get better at image/text detection.

## To Do List

1. Calibrate sampling intervals and skips (to increase performance)
2. Detect when player is in training but not looking for match

## Features to add

1. Automatically find all Tekken vods in a youtube channel
2. Multithreading
3. Graphical representation of data using React
