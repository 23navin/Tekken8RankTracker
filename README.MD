# Tekken 8 Rank Tracker

A Python script that uses OpenCV and PyTesseract to track a player's Tekken 8 rank progression from a youtube vod. This is a personal project and my first time using python. It is not complete and will probably go through many revisions as I learn the language and get better at image/text detection.

## To Do List

1. Detect when player is in training but not looking for match
2. Find a way to check for lost connections
3. adj only tracks neg adjustments (filter red/blue channel)
4. improve opponent name detection (increase threshold and )
5. docker is missing libraries

## Features to add

1. Automatically find all Tekken vods in a youtube channel
2. Allow multiple resolutions
3. Multithreading
4. Graphical representation of data using React
